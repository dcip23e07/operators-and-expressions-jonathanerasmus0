# Expressions whether true or false

# 5 is greater than 4 and 3 is equal to 5

# The answer is false with an AND 

# not (5 > 4)

# The initial expression is true because 5 is greater than 4.
# BUT because its a NOT  This means it is FALSE

 #(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
 # first is true second is false
 # but the answer is TRUE

 #not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
 # The two expressions in brackets are TRUE, BUT
 # The NOT at the beginning means the overall expression is
 #FALSE

  #(True and True) and (True == False)

#This is an AND expression. So: first expression is TRUE
#Second is FALSE
#So both conditions must be TRUE but they arent so:
#The expression is FALSE

#(not False) or (not True)
