1. #what is the result of :
   # i. var_a == var_b 
    #ii. var_a is var_b
    #(can you explain using comments the reason for the result)

    # Answers , 1. var_a = 400 and b = 200 + 200 : I think this is TRUE

    #2. i. var_a == var_c 
    #ii. var_a is var_c

    # first expression is True because they are equal
    # second is false bc it will use the same mem?
    # not really sure to be honest.


    #3. what is the result of :
    #i. var_a == var_d 
    #ii. var_a is var_d
    #(can you explain using comments the reason for the result)

    # 400 is equal to 200+200 = true because they have the same value of int
    # 400 is equal to 400 as the same integer and use the same memory?
